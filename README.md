# mws-restaurant-stage-1

For this projects, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

## Before start 

1. Clone this respository.

2. Get a MapBox API key or access token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Replace the text `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` inside of main.js and restaurant_info.js with your key.

3. Open command line, go to new directory which has this respository, launch a local client server using Python from your terminal: 

    * Python 2: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 
    * Python 3: python -m http.server 8000

     If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

4. Visit the site in your browser at http://localhost:8000
